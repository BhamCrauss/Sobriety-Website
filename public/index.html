    This project was started in hopes of helping individuals struggling with alcoholism and addiction, as well as,
    sharing insights to those who love or work with them. The problem of alcoholism and addiction is nothing new, but in
    the midst of the opioid epidemic, we feel that there is still plenty of work that needs to be done.
    <br> <br>
    The survey used to gather the data used for this project was developed to be open-minded to all types of
    recovery processes and individuals. The survey is especially well suited to addicts and alcoholics who are currently
    sober or who have been sober in the past. We encourage you to participate in the survey if you have ever had a
    problem
    with alcoholism or addiction. Please feel free to share the link to this site and the survey!

    Our results on this website do not include information weâ€™ve gained on treatment centers, because our aim is to be
    collaborative with every entity involved in this problem and do not think it is right to publish any potentially
    negative findings
    about any organization.
    <br> <br>
    Please visit the contact page and reach out if you have any other questions or if you are interested in
    collaborating and expanding this project or if you are interested in creating a new one.
    <br> <br>
    Thank you so much for your interest and efforts!
