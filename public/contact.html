      Hey, I'm Chris Alexander<br><br>
      Substance abuse is growing problem in the US. The effect it has had on my hometown of Birmingham, Alabama
      has been tremendous as well. It has been a joy creating this project and has been a great to start trying to
      add to the bulk of work that is the solution to this epidemic. <br><br>
      Approaching the completion of the first phase of this project I am inspired to bolster my survey's effectiveness
      and breadth. I am, also, very encouraged with the ease and the number responses I got from my survey.
      With that encouragement, I plan to expand the number responses to include the rest of the US in the next versions
      of
      this project. <br><br>
      It would be a dream come true to expand this project or collaborate with another team to generate some tangible
      insight that would help anyone suffering from this disease and epidemic.<br><br>
      If you have any questions for me or if you want to contact me for any other reason, feel free to send me an
      email.<br><br>

      Thank you so much for taking the time to look at this project!
